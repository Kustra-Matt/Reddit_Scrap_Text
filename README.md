# Reddit_Law_School_Admissions_Scrape
 Script to look for posts about law schools my partner applied to. Script texts me the link to the post. Wrote a plist file so that my computer ran the code every 5 mintues or so.
 
Scrape_text.py is the python script 

Law_admissions_scraper.plist is the scheduler that runs the script every 50 miutes
